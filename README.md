# TurboVac

The tango device can read out data as well as send commands to an RS-232 controller for a Leybold TURBOVAC i or iX turbo vacuum pump.
The communication protocol was already coded into python 3.8 and can be found here https://github.com/fkivela/TurboCtl. So the code is based on the functions you can find in that package.
